This is a multi-signature wallet that supports ethers and any ERC-20 token.
This contract aims to be extremly simple. Why? Because it stores your money.
No more than 8 owners are allowed.
What if you need a change of owner? re-create a contract and transfer the funds there.
What if you need a change of threshold? re-create a contract and transfer the funds there.
That's it.
